#  Uber Fare Data Analysis Project

A comprehensive data analysis project exploring Uber ride fare data using **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)** for cleaning and **Power BI** for visualization.  
The goal is to identify ride patterns, fare distributions, and geographic trends to support business decisions.

---

##  Project Objectives

- Understand fare amount distribution and ride behavior.
- Identify time-based and location-based ride trends.
- Use data to make useful business suggestions.

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Data Source**: Kaggle Uber Dataset  
- **Data Cleaning**: Python (Pandas, NumPy in Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI

---

##  1. Data Preparation

###  Steps Taken:
- Removed missing or incorrect values.
- Converted date/time columns into proper datetime format.
- Extracted hour, weekday, and month from timestamp.
- Filtered out rides with invalid location (latitude/longitude outliers).
- Removed fare values less than 0 and extremely high outliers.

##  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### ðŸ”¹ Fare Amount Distribution
- Most fares are under a certain amount (long-tail distribution).
- Boxplots helped identify outliers in fare values.

### ðŸ”¹ Ride Time Analysis
- Grouped data by hour, weekday, and month.
- Found peak hours (early mornings and late evenings).
- More rides occurred during weekends and late afternoons.

### ðŸ”¹ Temporal Trends
- Created time series visuals to observe trends across hours, days, and months.
- Identified growth in ride frequency on weekends and during holiday seasons.

### ðŸ”¹ Geographic Insights
- Plotted pickup locations using latitude and longitude.
- City centers and busy areas showed high ride concentration.

##  3. Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes the following:

- **Fare Distribution**: Histograms and box plots
- **Ride Duration Trends**: Time-based charts (hour/day/month)
- **Time Series Analysis**: Visuals showing ride patterns over time
- **Geographic Mapping**: Map visual of pickup locations


---

##  4. Key Findings

- Most Uber fares are low-priced with a few high-value outliers.
- Ride volume increases during rush hours and weekends.
- Certain locations have very high ride activity.
- Seasonal and daily ride trends are visible and predictable.

---

## 5. Business Recommendations

- Apply dynamic pricing during busy hours.
- Add more drivers near high-demand areas.
- Offer promotions during low-demand hours.
- Use real-time ride and fare patterns for better planning.
